# PicoGame

PicoGame is a tiny game engine designed to run simple games on the Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Getting Started

Getting started with PicoGame is easy. In this quick tutorial, we will show how to get up and running with the example game.

### The Hardware
For this example, we are using a [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) connected to a ST7735S LCD screen (in our case [Waveshare Pico LCD 1.44](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Pico-LCD-1.44)).
